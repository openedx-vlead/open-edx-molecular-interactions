<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>&epsilon;</b></span> = the minimum (well depth) of the potential for the interaction between atom i and j.</p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>&sigma;<sub>ij</sub></b></span> = the collision diameter,at which inter particle potential is zero.</p>
<p><b>r<sub>ij</sub></b> = the distance between the particles.</p>
<p align="justify">The parameters &epsilon;,&sigma; is not given for a specific pair and can be found by using Lorentz-berthelot rules,</p>
