<p align="justify"><b>Ion-Dipole Forces</b> An ion-dipole force is an attractive force that results from the electrostatic attraction between an ion and a neutral molecule that has a dipole. The induced dipole forces appear from the induction (also known as polarization), which is the attractive interaction between a permanent multipole on one molecule with an induced (by the former di/multi-pole) multipole on another. This interaction is called Debye force after Peter J.W. Debye. The example of an induction-interaction between permanent dipole and induced dipole is HCl and Ar. In this system, Ar experiences a dipole as its electrons are attracted (to H side) or repelled (from Cl side) by HCl. This kind of interaction can be expected between any polar molecule and non-polar/symmetrical molecule. The induction-interaction force is far weaker than dipole-dipole interaction, however stronger than London force.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Dipole-Dipole Interactions</b></p>
<p align="justify">Dipole&minus;dipole interactions are electrostatic interactions of permanent dipoles in molecules. These interactions tend to align the molecules to increase the attraction (reducing potential energy). An example of a dipole&minus;dipole interaction can be seen in hydrogen chloride (HCl): The positive end of a polar molecule will attract the negative end of the other molecule and cause them to be arranged in a specific arrangement. Polar molecules have a net attraction between them. For example HCl and chloroform (CHCl<sub>3</sub>).</p>

<p align="justify">London Dispersion forces:</p>
<p align="justify">London dispersion forces (LDF, also known as dispersion forces, London forces, instantaneous dipole&minus;induced dipole forces) is a type of force acting between atoms and molecules.[1] They are part of the van der Waals forces. The LDF is named after the German-American physicist Fritz London.</p>
<p align="justify">The LDF is a weak intermolecular force arising from quantum induced instantaneous polarization multipoles in molecules. They can therefore act between molecules without permanent multipole moments. London forces are exhibited by non-polar molecules because of the correlated movements of the electrons in interacting molecules. Because the electrons from different molecules start "feeling" and avoiding each other, electron density in a molecule becomes redistributed in proximity to another molecule.</p>
<p align="justify">This is frequently described as formation of "instantaneous dipoles" that attract each other. London forces are present between all chemical groups and usually represent the main part of the total interaction force in condensed matter, even though they are generally weaker than ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds.</p>
