<p align="justify">Chromatography,a greek word which means color writing [chrom:color graphy:writing] is collective term for set of laboratory techniques used for separation of mixtures. This process use to separate molecules based on physical properties of molecules such as</p>
<ul type="square">
<li>Mass</li>
<li>Charge</li>
<li>Hydrophobic interactions</li>
<li>Affinity for ligands or substrate</li>
</ul>
<p align="justfy">The basic idea here is that different components of a mixture interact differently with a common medium (it can be a solid substrate or a liquid medium). The differences in the interactions between the mixture and the medium are utilized to separate the components from the mixture. By allowing a mixture to run through a column, which is packed with a suitable medium, the components can be separated out. Among all the chromatographic techniques column chromatography is widely used owing to its low cost and disposability of the stationary phase.</p>
<p align="justfy"><br />Definition's of some general terms used in these techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Elute:</b>&nbsp; is the mobile phase leaving the column</li>
<li><b>Analyate:</b>&nbsp;is the substance to be separated during chromatography</li>
<li><b>Mobile phase:</b> &nbsp;This consists of solvent and sample which needs to be separated,this phase moves along the column in a definite direction.Mobile phase may be liquid,gas or fluid</li>
<li><b>Stationary phase:</b>&nbsp; Phase which remains stationary called stationary phase,generally packing material used to fill the column acts as stationary phase.</li>
</ul>
<p align="justfy">This experiment demonstrates how inter-atomic interactions are used to purify mixtures. A simplified version of the column chromatography is used here to provide the atomistic details of purification of a binary mixture (a mixture consisting of two types of atoms).</p>
