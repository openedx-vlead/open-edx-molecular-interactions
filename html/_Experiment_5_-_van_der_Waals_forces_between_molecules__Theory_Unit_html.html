<p align="justify">The Lennard-Jones potential is an effective potential that describes the interaction between two uncharged molecules or atoms. The Lennard--Jones potential is mildly attractive as two uncharged molecules or atoms approach one another from a distance, but strongly repulsive when they approach too close. The resulting potential is shown in figure below, at equilibrium the pair of atoms or molecules tend to go toward a separation corresponding to the minimum of the Lennard-Jones potential.</p>

<p align="justify">The Lennard Jones potential is common potential used to model VanderWaals interactions.<br /> The strong close in repulsion between atoms or molecules is understandable, resulting from mutual deformation of their structures (meaning, one atom cannot diffuse through another) . When two uncharged particles approach one another, the electron clouds of the competing particles undergo a deformation. During the interaction, each particle does not have a symmetrical electron cloud. As a result each acquires a dipole moment. This is called an induced dipole moment. It lasts for only the short time of near approach, but during this time particles with dipoles are attracted to each other. This attraction is called the London or Van der Waals force. The potential resulting from these attractive and repulsive interactions is called the Lennard--Jones potential,which is given by</p>
