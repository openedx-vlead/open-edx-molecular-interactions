<p align="justify"><b>Bond Stretching:</b></p>
<p align="justify">The oscillatory motion of two bonded atoms relative to each other. This motion consist of the two bonded atoms stretching passed their equilibrium position, then returning to their equilibrium position, and finally contracting passed their equilibrium position. This kind of motion is called Bond stretching.</p>
<p align="justify">The bond stretching can be generally explained by considering just attaching a spring in between two atoms, as shown in the figure below.</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="http://mi-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/exp8/strec.gif" align="middle" height="100" width="200" /></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">When the mass of one of the atoms is thought be high when compared to the other, it is similar to a mass loaded by spring. Hooke's law can be applied to this system. Now the question is, how the energy of this system changes with change in stretching and compression of the bond? To find a functional form for bond stretching interactions it is helpful to consider how the energy of a bond changes with its length. The energy of a bond is lowest at a particular natural or reference length. If the bond is then compressed the electron clouds of the two atoms forming it will gradually overlap. This leads to a rapid increase in energy. If the bond is stretched beyond equilibrium the energy starts to increase. Eventually however, the bond dissociates.</p>
<p align="justify">For small deviations from the equilibrium bond length the energy can be written as a taylor expansion in r-r<sub>0</sub>, with r<sub>0</sub> representing the equilibrium bond-length.</p>

<p align="justify">In its simplest form,the above equation is terminated at the (r-r<sub>0</sub>)<sup>2</sup> term. This is called the harmonic approximation. setting E(r<sub>0</sub>)=0, and noting that at r=r<sub>0</sub> the force and hence first derivative of the energy is zero, we have</p>

<p align="justify">The reference bond length r<sub>0</sub> is often called the equilibrium bond length. This is slightly misleading as the reference bond length is the bond length when all the other force field terms are set to 0, while the equilibrium bond length is the bond length for the minimum energy configuration of the molecule (i.e. when E<sub>ff</sub>=0). The forces between bonded atoms are very high in comparison to other forces. This is the justification for using the harmonic approximation. It is important to remember that this is an approximation to the real bond stretching potential and that for large deviations from r<sub>0</sub> the harmonic approximation no longer holds true. For situations where the bond lengths may deviate far from r<sub>0</sub> or to accurately calculate molecular structures and vibrational frequencies it is necessary to go beyond the harmonic approximation and include higher order terms usually up to (r-r<sub>0</sub>)<sup>4</sup>. At some inter-nuclear distance the atoms are far enough apart so that they do not "feel" each other. That is, they are isolated and the bond is broken. A more realistic model of the potential well of a diatomic molecule is the Morse potential, which does model the dissociation energy.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Bond angle:</b></p>
<p align="justify">The angle between two bonds sharing a common atom is known as the bond angle.</p>

<li><img src="http://mi-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/exp8/angle.jpeg" align="middle" height="200" width="200" /></li>
<li>
<p align="justify">The distortion in the angle of the molecule helps the molecule to store energy in the form of potential energy. This storage of energy in molecule referred as a "strain". The potential energy stored due to the displacement of bond angle from equilibrium positions is called "Angle Strain". For eg: The angle strain in the molecule of cyclopropane renders it to be highly unstable and reactive due large amount of potential energy stored in it.</p>
<p align="justify">As bond angles are found (experimentally and theoretically) to vary around a single value it is sufficient in most applications to use a harmonic representation (in a similar manner to the bond potential)</p>

The torsional angle &Phi;<sub>ijkl</sub> is the angle between the plane going through the atoms i, j and k and the plane going through the atoms j, k and l.<br /> For each of these two planes the normal vectors can be calculated by taking the cross product of two vectors lying in this plane,<br /> where the directions of the vectors have to be chosen in a clever way to get the torsional angle in accordance with the IUPAC/IUB convention. The dihedral angle of two planes can be seen by looking at the planes "edge on", i.e., along their line of intersection. The dihedral angle &Phi;<sub>AB</sub> between two planes denoted A and B is the angle between their two normal unit vectors <b>n<sub>A</sub></b> and <b>n<sub>B</sub></b>: Dihedral angle is also called as face angle.</p>

By using this definition the same equations, can be used to compute the torsional angle, Since the improper torsion potential is mainly used to maintain planarity in a molecular structure. Hence, it only has one minimum and a harmonic potential may be used. Therefore the improper torsion functional form is given by</p>

When two uncharged particles approach one another, the electron clouds of the competing particles undergo a deformation. During the interaction, each particle does not have a symmetrical electron cloud. As a result each acquires a dipole moment. This is called an induced dipole moment. It lasts for only the short time of near approach, but during this time particles with dipoles are attracted to each other (see Fig. 3.5.4a and Fig. 3.5.4b).
